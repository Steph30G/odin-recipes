        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The blooming onion is a popular appetizer consisting of a large onion cut to resemble a flower, often with a dipping sauce in the middle.
            The onion is battered and deep-fried after being cut in a flower like shape. It is a great way to enjoy your meal and adds a complementary flavor 
            to it. Although similar to onion rings the blooming onion has a slightly different flavor as the whole onion is crispy and greasy.
